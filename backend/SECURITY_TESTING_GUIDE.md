Quick guide to test all security features before production deployment.

---

## üöÄ Prerequisites

1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Seed the database: `npm run seed`
3. Use Postman, Thunder Client, or curl

---

## Test 1: Rate Limiting on Login

### Goal: Verify login rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)

**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Try 6 consecutive login attempts with wrong password
# Requests 1-5 should return 401 with attempt count
# Request 6 should return 429 (Too Many Requests)

POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "admin@farmtocup.com",
  "password": "wrongpassword"
}

# Repeat 6 times quickly
```

**Expected Results:**
- First 5 attempts: `429 Too Many Requests` or rate limit message
- Should see: "Too many login attempts, please try again after 15 minutes"

**‚úÖ Pass:** Rate limiter blocks after 5 attempts
**‚ùå Fail:** Can make unlimited attempts

---

## Test 2: Account Lockout After Failed Logins

### Goal: Verify account locks after 5 failed password attempts

**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Wait 15 minutes after Test 1 (or use different IP/clear rate limit)
# Try 5 consecutive logins with wrong password

POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "cashier@farmtocup.com",
  "password": "WrongPassword@123"
}

# Repeat 5 times
```

**Expected Results:**
- Attempts 1-4: `401 Unauthorized` with "X attempts remaining"
- Attempt 5: `423 Locked` - "Too many failed login attempts. Account locked for 15 minutes."
- Attempt 6: `423 Locked` - "Account is locked. Please try again in X minutes."

**‚úÖ Pass:** Account locks after 5 failed attempts
**‚ùå Fail:** Can keep trying unlimited times

---

## Test 3: Strong Password Validation

### Goal: Verify password complexity requirements

**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Login as admin first
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@farmtocup.com",
  "password": "Admin@123"
}

# Try to create user with weak password
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
{
  "firstName": "Test",
  "lastName": "User",
  "email": "test@farmtocup.com",
  "password": "weak",
  "role": "cashier"
}
```

**Test Cases:**
| Password | Should Pass? | Reason |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| `weak` | ‚ùå | Too short, no complexity |
| `password123` | ‚ùå | No uppercase, no special char |
| `PASSWORD123!` | ‚ùå | No lowercase |
| `Password!` | ‚ùå | No number |
| `Pass@123` | ‚úÖ | Meets all requirements |

**Expected Results:**
- Weak passwords: `400 Bad Request` with validation error
- Strong password: `201 Created`

**‚úÖ Pass:** Only strong passwords accepted
**‚ùå Fail:** Weak passwords are accepted

## Test 4: NoSQL Injection Protection

### Goal: Verify MongoDB operator injection is blocked

**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Try to inject MongoDB operators in login
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": { "$gt": "" },
  "password": { "$gt": "" }
}

# Try injection in query params
GET http://localhost:5000/api/products?search={"$gt":""}
```

**Expected Results:**
- Login: Should fail (not bypass authentication)
- Search: Should sanitize and search for literal string
- No unauthorized access

**‚úÖ Pass:** Operators are sanitized
**‚ùå Fail:** Can bypass authentication or access unauthorized data

---

## Test 5: XSS Protection

### Goal: Verify script injection is prevented

**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Login as admin
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@farmtocup.com",
  "password": "Admin@123"
}

# Try to inject script in product name
POST http://localhost:5000/api/products
{
  "name": "<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
  "description": "Test product",
  "category": "CATEGORY_ID",
  "variants": [{
    "size": "12oz",
    "temperature": "hot",
    "price": 100,
    "cost": 50
  }]
}

# Retrieve the product
GET http://localhost:5000/api/products
```

**Expected Results:**
- Product created successfully
- Script tags are sanitized or escaped
- When retrieved, should not contain executable script

**‚úÖ Pass:** Scripts are sanitized
**‚ùå Fail:** Raw script tags are stored

---

## Test 6: Request Size Limit

### Goal: Verify large payloads are rejected

**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Try to send payload larger than 10KB
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "admin@farmtocup.com",
  "password": "Admin@123",
  "extraData": "<insert 11KB of random text here>"
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- `413 Payload Too Large` or similar error
- Request is rejected before processing

**‚úÖ Pass:** Large payloads rejected
**‚ùå Fail:** Large payloads accepted

---

## Test 7: API Rate Limiting

### Goal: Verify general API rate limiting (100 req/15min)

**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Make 101 consecutive requests to any endpoint
# Use a script or tool to automate

for i in {1..101}
do
  curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
done
```

**Expected Results:**
- Requests 1-100: Success (200 OK)
- Request 101: `429 Too Many Requests`

**‚úÖ Pass:** Rate limiter blocks at 101
**‚ùå Fail:** Unlimited requests allowed

---

## Test 8: CORS Protection

### Goal: Verify CORS blocks unauthorized origins

**Test Steps:**
```bash
# Try to make request from different origin
curl -H "Origin: http://evil-site.com" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-Requested-With" \
     -X OPTIONS \
     http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
```

**Expected Results:**
- Request blocked or no CORS headers returned for unauthorized origin
- Only `http://localhost:5173` allowed in development

**‚úÖ Pass:** Unauthorized origins blocked
**‚ùå Fail:** Any origin can access API

## Test 9: JWT Token Security

### Goal: Verify JWT tokens are secure

**Test Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Login and get token
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@farmtocup.com",
  "password": "Admin@123"
}

# 2. Check cookie attributes in browser/Postman
# Should see:
# - HttpOnly: true
# - SameSite: Strict
# - Secure: true (in production)

# 3. Try to access protected route without token
GET http://localhost:5000/api/users
# (without sending cookie)

# 4. Try with invalid token
Cookie: token=invalid_token_here
GET http://localhost:5000/api/users
```

**Expected Results:**
- Without token: `401 Unauthorized`
- Invalid token: `401 Unauthorized`
- Cookie has HttpOnly and SameSite flags
- Token expires after 7 days

**‚úÖ Pass:** JWT properly secured
**‚ùå Fail:** Can access protected routes without valid token
