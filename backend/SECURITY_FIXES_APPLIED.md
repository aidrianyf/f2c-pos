# ‚úÖ Security Fixes Applied

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** PRIORITY 1 FIXES COMPLETED

---

## üéØ Summary

All **Priority 1 Critical** security issues have been fixed and implemented. The backend is now significantly more secure and ready for further testing.

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting Added**
**Status:** FIXED
**Files Modified:** `server.js`

**What was added:**
- General API rate limiter: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Strict auth rate limiter: 5 login/register attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- Configured for reverse proxy compatibility

```javascript
// General limiter for all API routes
windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
max: 100

// Strict limiter for auth routes
windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
max: 5
```

**Impact:** Prevents brute force attacks and API abuse

---

### 2. ‚úÖ **NoSQL Injection Protection**
**Status:** FIXED
**Files Modified:** `server.js`
**Package Installed:** `express-mongo-sanitize`

**What was added:**
- Automatic sanitization of all user inputs
- Removal of MongoDB operators from request data
- Protection against query injection attacks

```javascript
app.use(mongoSanitize());
```

**Impact:** Prevents attackers from injecting MongoDB operators

---

### 3. ‚úÖ **XSS Protection**
**Status:** FIXED
**Files Modified:** `server.js`
**Package Installed:** `xss-clean`

**What was added:**
- Sanitization of user input to prevent XSS attacks
- Cleaning of malicious scripts from request data

```javascript
app.use(xss());
```

**Impact:** Prevents cross-site scripting attacks

---

### 4. ‚úÖ **Request Size Limits**
**Status:** FIXED
**Files Modified:** `server.js`

**What was added:**
- Limited JSON payload to 10KB
- Limited URL-encoded payload to 10KB

```javascript
app.use(express.json({ limit: '10kb' }));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: '10kb' }));
```

**Impact:** Prevents DoS attacks via large payloads

---

### 5. ‚úÖ **Stronger Password Requirements**
**Status:** FIXED
**Files Modified:** `models/User.js`, `utils/seeder.js`

**What was changed:**
- Minimum password length: 6 ‚Üí 8 characters
- Added complexity requirements:
  - At least 1 uppercase letter
  - At least 1 lowercase letter
  - At least 1 number
  - At least 1 special character

**New validation regex:**
```javascript
/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&#^()_+=\-\[\]{};:'"\\|,.<>\/~`])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&#^()_+=\-\[\]{};:'"\\|,.<>\/~`]{8,}$/
```

**Updated default passwords:**
- Admin: `Admin@123`
- Cashier: `Cashier@123`

**Impact:** Significantly harder to brute force passwords

---

### 6. ‚úÖ **Account Lockout After Failed Login Attempts**
**Status:** FIXED
**Files Modified:** `models/User.js`, `controllers/authController.js`

**What was added:**
- Track login attempts per user
- Lock account after 5 failed attempts
- Lockout duration: 15 minutes
- Display remaining attempts to user
- Auto-reset on successful login

**New User fields:**
```javascript
loginAttempts: { type: Number, default: 0 },
lockUntil: { type: Date }
```

**Impact:** Prevents unlimited brute force attempts per account

---

### 7. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Security Headers**
**Status:** FIXED
**Files Modified:** `server.js`

**What was configured:**
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - Max Age: 1 year
  - Include subdomains
  - Preload ready

```javascript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"]
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

**Impact:** Additional protection against various attacks

---

### 8. ‚úÖ **Proxy Trust Configuration**
**Status:** FIXED
**Files Modified:** `server.js`

**What was added:**
- Enabled trust proxy for correct IP detection behind load balancers
- Ensures rate limiting works correctly in production

```javascript
app.set('trust proxy', 1);
```

**Impact:** Rate limiting works correctly in production environments

---

## üì¶ New Dependencies Installed

```json
{
  "express-mongo-sanitize": "^2.2.0",
  "express-rate-limit": "^8.1.0",
  "xss-clean": "^0.1.4"
}
```

---

## üß™ Testing Required

Before deploying to production, test the following:

### Rate Limiting Tests:
- [ ] Try 6 login attempts in 15 minutes (should be blocked)
- [ ] Try 101 API requests in 15 minutes (should be blocked)
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly

### Account Lockout Tests:
- [ ] Try 5 failed login attempts (account should lock)
- [ ] Wait 15 minutes and try again (should work)
- [ ] Verify lockout countdown is accurate
- [ ] Confirm successful login resets attempt counter

### Password Validation Tests:
- [ ] Try weak password: "password" (should fail)
- [ ] Try no uppercase: "password123!" (should fail)
- [ ] Try no number: "Password!" (should fail)
- [ ] Try strong password: "Admin@123" (should succeed)

### NoSQL Injection Tests:
- [ ] Try injecting `{"$gt": ""}` in email field (should sanitize)
- [ ] Try query operators in search params (should sanitize)

### XSS Tests:
- [ ] Try `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in product name (should sanitize)
- [ ] Try JavaScript in any text field (should clean)

### Size Limit Tests:
- [ ] Send JSON payload > 10KB (should reject with 413 error)

---

## üî¥ Still Requires Attention (Priority 2 & 3)

### Priority 2 (Recommend before launch):
1. **Input Validation**: Add express-validator to all routes
2. **JWT Token Blacklist**: Implement token invalidation on logout
3. **Email Verification**: Add email confirmation flow
4. **Strong JWT Secret**: Generate cryptographically secure secret for production
5. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Add redirect middleware for production

### Priority 3 (Can be added post-launch):
6. **CSRF Protection**: Add CSRF tokens
7. **Audit Logging**: Log security events (logins, failures, admin actions)
8. **2FA**: Implement two-factor authentication
9. **Session Management**: Add session timeout and renewal
10. **API Versioning**: Implement for easier security updates

---

## üìù Configuration Changes Needed for Production

### Update .env file:
```bash
# Generate secure JWT secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"

# Then update .env:
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=<generated_secure_secret_here>
MONGODB_URI=<your_atlas_connection_string>
CLIENT_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### MongoDB Atlas:
- [ ] Set up IP whitelist
- [ ] Enable authentication
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts

### Server/Deployment:
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure automated security updates
- [ ] Set up backup strategy

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Run the seeder again** with new password requirements:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

2. **Test all security features** using the testing checklist above

3. **Update API documentation** with new password requirements

4. **Review Priority 2 items** and plan implementation

5. **Prepare production environment** with proper configurations
